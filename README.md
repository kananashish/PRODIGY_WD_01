# Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation

## Project Description
A modern, responsive landing page featuring a fixed navigation menu with dynamic scroll-based color changes, vibrant hover effects, and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu. The page is enhanced with an animated particle background using `particles.js`, creating a visually engaging, tech-forward aesthetic. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases smooth interactivity, professional design, and accessibility, making it ideal for portfolios, startups, or tech-focused websites.

## Features
- **Fixed Navigation Menu**: Stays visible at the top across all pages/scroll positions.
- **Scroll-Based Animation**: Navbar transitions from a light to a dark blue gradient when scrolling past 50px.
- **Hover Effects**: Menu items feature a green background, white text, and an animated underline on hover.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Includes a hamburger menu that animates into a cross on toggle for screens below 768px.
- **Dynamic Background**: Animated particles (via `particles.js`) with hover repulsion and click-to-add effects, set against a blue-gray gradient.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Anchor links provide seamless navigation to page sections.
- **Hero Section**: Bold typography, motivational tagline, and a vibrant CTA button for a strong first impression.
- **Professional Styling**: Uses Poppins font, gradient effects, subtle shadows, and rounded elements for a polished look.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: For responsive design, animations, and gradient styling.
- **JavaScript**: For scroll detection, hamburger menu toggle, smooth scrolling, and particle animations.
- **Particles.js**: For the dynamic, interactive background.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font for modern typography.
